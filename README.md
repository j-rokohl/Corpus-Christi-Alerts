# üö® Corpus Christi Alerts üå©Ô∏è

## App Features

This app has the following features:

- Offline capabilities if a connection is lost
- Has app-like-interactions and UI
- Has fresh content
- Is Safe (served over HTTPS)
- Is progressive (browser-agnostic)

##  Service Worker

This is a very basic service worker that listens for three main events:
- Install - Caches static assets specified in the ASSETS_TO_CACHE array.
- Activate - Handles outdated caches and sets up the service worker for operation.
- Fetch - Captures network requests and delivers cached responses when they exist.

In addition, the graphicast.js script caches external assets (image files) from the weather.gov api. 

##  Caching Strategy

The service worker initially facilitates the caching of core static assets that are stored locally. 

For the external image files displayed on the main page, the cache is opened after the image status code is confirmed to be okay, and the associated metadata confirms that the image is still active and has not expired.  

##  Manifest File
